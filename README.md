# Proman

## Introduction

Welcome to the Proman project! Proman is a one-page project management tool inspired by Trello, designed to simplify project management and collaboration. This Readme provides an overview of the project, its features, technologies used, and the progress made during the first two sprints.

## Project Overview

Proman is aimed at providing a user-friendly, intuitive interface for managing projects and tasks. It allows users to create, delete, and organize boards, move cards between columns, and offers real-time collaboration through live synchronization.

## Sprints

### First Sprint

In the first sprint, we started by setting up the project and getting familiar with the existing codebase. We also planned the distribution of tasks among the team members.

We then proceeded to work on the main features, including:

- Implementation of a board list overview.
- User handling, including registration and login/logout functionality.
- Adding new boards with a distinction between public and private ones.
- Adding new cards with the ability to move them between columns.

### Second Sprint

In the second sprint, we built upon the progress made in the first sprint. We merged the previous sprint's work and completed any remaining tasks.

During this sprint, we focused on the following:

- Ordering cards within boards.
- Manual synchronization for real-time collaboration.
- Managing columns, including Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.
- Implementation of live synchronization for enhanced real-time collaboration with use of Flask--SocketIO.
- Fixing any merging issues that arose during development.
- Debugging and refining the application.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Configure your PostgreSQL database.
5. Run the application using Flask.
